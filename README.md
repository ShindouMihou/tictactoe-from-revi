# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created in Java with a custom bot.

#### How does the bot work?
- [x] The bot utilizes simulations to decide its next possible target,
by simulating a check win on every possible move for both the player and the bot.
It decides where to place its attack on, it will always prioritize a win for it side
but if there is no chance of winning then it will head for defense if the bot senses a chance of winning
on the enemy side's otherwise it will go for a random value.

#### Requirements
- [x] Java 11 (OpenJDK, recommended).
